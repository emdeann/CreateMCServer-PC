# Setting Up the Minecraft Server

## Description

This repository contains a starter kit to set up a Minecraft server capable of running our Python code. It contains two folders: one with the Minecraft server and one with the required Python library. The `Python Files` folder is also where we should store and run any Python files we have or make.
Your computer must also have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/) installed to run Python code, and [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/) to run the server. IDLE comes with Python, which is the editor we used during camp. **You will need to check a box in the Python installer to make sure it includes IDLE. Do not forget to do this.**

I will note here that the version of Python I linked is 3.8, which is not the latest version. This is intentional - mcpi was written long ago and the version we use is not compatible with versions of Python above 3.8. I am looking to personally update it at some point to keep the project alive, so feel free to send me a message if you'd like an update when I get around to it!

## Server Setup Guide

* Download the code by clicking `Code` on the top right of this page, and then clicking `Download ZIP`.
* Unzip the downloaded file using a tool like WinRAR (For MacOS, simply double click the downloaded file), and you will be left with a parent folder containing the two subfolders.
* The default Minecraft version for this server is Minecraft 1.12.2. If you (ask your child) want to use a different version of Minecraft, download the corresponding file [here](https://getbukkit.org/download/spigot).
* If you downloaded a different file, rename it to `spigot.jar` and place it in the `Server` folder. In the same folder, run `start.bat` (Windows) or `start.command` (MacOS). You may need to run it twice, after it exits automatically the first time. This is only required once. (By completing this step, you are agreeing to the Minecraft [EULA](https://account.mojang.com/documents/minecraft_eula)).
  * If this step fails, it is likely because you never installed Java or the wrong version was installed. If you are using a newer Minecraft server than the one provided here, you will likely need Java 17 to run it. That can be installed [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17). Further Java troubleshooting problems are out of the scope of this guide, but you are free to shoot me a message if you encounter issues. 
  * **MacOS Only:**
      * `start.command` will likely not run the first time. If you see a popup saying it "can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer", you need to override this to open the file. `start.command` is completely safe, it simply opens the server with the correct settings.
        1. Go to your Security and Privacy settings inside System Preferences
        2. You will see a line at the bottom saying that `start.command` was blocked: click `Open Anyway` and enter your password.
        3. In the popup that shows up next, click `Open`
 
* After you run it the second time (if necessary), you should see another black cmd window open. Let it run until you see `Done (Xs)! For help, type "help" or "?"`. Once you see this, your server is open and joinable.

## Joining the Server
* On the same computer that is hosting the server, you can join it by clicking "Direct Connect" in the Multiplayer menu of Minecraft and using `localhost` as the server address.
* On a different computer which is **on the same network**, you can join the server by typing your [local IP address](https://www.whatismybrowser.com/detect/what-is-my-local-ip-address) instead of localhost.
* It is possible to open the server so friends not on the same network can join and play together, but this is a more complex process which will not be detailed here. I can recommend [this](https://thebreakdown.xyz/how-to-port-forward-for-a-minecraft-server/#port-forwarding-for-your-minecraft-server) guide on the topic (be aware that doing this improperly can cause vulnerabilities in your WiFi network, so proceed with caution).

## Running Python Code on the Server
* To run Python code on the server, a few things must line up:
  * The Minecraft server must be open and running
  * The player must be online in Minecraft, and join the correct Minecraft server
  * Python must be installed
  * The Python files **must be in the `Python Files` folder**
* Once these are true, code can be run. The easiest way to do this is to open IDLE, and open a file brought home on the flash drive. Make sure this file is placed in the `Python Files` folder first. By clicking `Run` -> `Run Module`, this file will run and its effect will be seen in the Minecraft world.
* Students should have a basic understanding of IDLE after the week is over, but I will nonetheless provide a guide to IDLE and to our Python tool, mcpi, for ease of use.
  * [IDLE](https://realpython.com/python-idle/)
  * [mcpi](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-minecraft-pi/7) (Note: This is the official mcpi tutorial, which assumes that you are using a Raspberry Pi. This is not the case, so some aspects of the game may look different. However, the code will work identically in most cases.)
  * If you would like to avoid the need to run files from only the `Python Files` folder, you are able to install mcpi using [pip](https://packaging.python.org/installing/). However, this is a bit more technically involved.
 
## Overview

This should provide all the information you need to get your child started, and continue their coding journey in Minecraft from home. If they are older and express a strong interest in coding with Minecraft, I highly recommend looking into more advanced concepts, like plugins and mods. This will use the Java programming language, and be both much more challenging and much more rewarding.

If you have any trouble, please feel free to reach out by email. Thanks!
